# Link-Quality-Prediction-for-LTE-and-WiFi-Networks
* Paper under review at the <b>'IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management'</b> Journal.
* Classifying the future link qualities using deep learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks (BLSTM). 
* The received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and packet data rate (PDR) are two parameters used in BLSTM. The result of prediction is compared with the state-of-art works.
* Obtained **2.1%** better prediction compared to the **SOTA**. The predicted result is used to offload the data using LTE and WiFi.
